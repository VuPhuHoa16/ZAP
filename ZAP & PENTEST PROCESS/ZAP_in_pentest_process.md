- Secondly, Zap took the third step in Pentest (Scanning):
    + Using the operation mechanism of the active scan mode, Zap has issued a warning and judgment of potential vulnerabilities

- Finally, Zap supports Pentester to implement step 5, by making a description of the potential vulnerabilities that it scans

5. Evidences in log (access.log)
- find all the hyperlinks in the page (spider mechanism) ![alt text](image-7.png)
